# Online Payments Fraud Detection using Machine Learning
## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on detecting online payment fraud using Machine Learning techniques.  
We trained a classification model to identify whether a transaction is fraudulent or not based on transaction features.
We also deployed the model using **Flask Web Framework** so that users can interact with the model through a simple web interface.

## 📥 Dataset Information

**Important Note:**  
We have **NOT uploaded the dataset file in this repository** because the dataset size is large (~25GB) and exceeds GitHub's upload limits.

### Dataset Source:

- Kaggle: [Online Payment Fraud Detection Dataset](/kaggle/input/online-payments-fraud-detection-dataset)

## 🛠️ Machine Learning Workflow

1. **Data Collection:**  
  Downloaded online payment transaction dataset.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**  
  Cleaned the data, handled missing values, explored fraud patterns.

3. **Feature Engineering:**  
  Selected important features for better model accuracy.

4. **Model Building:**  
  Trained different models like Random Forest Classifier, Decision Tree Classifier etc.

5. **Model Evaluation:**  
  Used metrics like Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score.

6. **Deployment:**  
  Built a simple Flask web app for end-user predictions.

**Note:**  
The app will run only on the local system (localhost:5000) and is not accessible to others unless hosted online (like on PythonAnywhere).
##How to run the project locally 
When you run : Python app.py
Flask launches the app on:
http://127.0.0.1:5000



## 🌐 Deployment Link 

The project is deployed and running live on PythonAnywhere. You can access the live app here:

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates how Machine Learning can help detect online payment frauds.
It covers model training, evaluation, and web deployment using Flask.
