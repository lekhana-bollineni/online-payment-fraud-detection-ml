# Online Payments Fraud Detection using Machine Learning
## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on detecting online payment fraud using Machine Learning techniques.  
We trained a classification model to identify whether a transaction is fraudulent or not based on transaction features.
We also deployed the model using **Flask Web Framework** so that users can interact with the model through a simple web interface.

## 🛠️ Machine Learning Workflow

1. **Data Collection:**  
  Downloaded online payment transaction dataset.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**  
  Cleaned the data, handled missing values, explored fraud patterns.

3. **Feature Engineering:**  
  Selected important features for better model accuracy.

4. **Model Building:**  
  Trained different models like Random Forest Classifier, etc.

5. **Model Evaluation:**  
  Used metrics like Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score.

6. **Deployment:**  
  Built a simple Flask web app for end-user predictions.
